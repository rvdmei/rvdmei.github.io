In simple terms: I am a geek, a married one, but still a geek. I have been working in the software industry since the early-90’s and have been working at Royal Dutch KPN since 1999.

## Me and Technology

I have been around in the industry and worked my way up from software engineer to senior IT architect. Along the way I have developed a special interest in agile software development, open source software, open source licensing and open source culture. I also, kind of, have developed an addiction to spending vast amounts of money on Apple hardware.

## Personal stuff

I’m married and a proud father. My first child was born in 2011, my second in 2013. I’m passionate about technology, you will find it hard to see me without some sort of gadget in my hands or behind a screen. When I’m not I’m either spending time with my family or busy practicing a martial art, playing bass guitar or darts. I have a special interest in Japanese martial arts, I practice Aikido at the Waraku Dojo in Dordrecht and have practiced Koryu Shinkage Ryu Iaido at the Kodokan Dojo in Rotterdam.

## Work

I’m working as senior IT architect at KPN. KPN is the biggest telecoms service provider in The Netherlands. I specialize in telecoms operations, IT architecture and agile software development. At KPN I'm one of the technical leads for the systems that monitor the availability and performance of KPNs core infrastructure and end-user services.
